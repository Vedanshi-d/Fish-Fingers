<h1>The Tasty Recipe</h1>
<h2>How Do You Make A Cheese Sandwich?</h2>
<p>This classic cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>

<p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain sliced American cheese – it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>

<p>Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.</p>

<p>This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.</p>



<p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade sandwiches:</p>

<p>1. Butter the bread on one side and place the bread butter-side down on a hot skillet.</p>
<p>2. Top with cheese, then place another slice of bread on top (butter-side up).</p>
<p>3. Cook until the bottom slice is lightly browned, then flip.</p>
<p>4. Continue cooking until the cheese is melted.</p>


<p>Cheese sandwiches are delicious with all sorts of sides and entrees, but they pair particularly well with tomato-based soups and stews. Have a good meal!</p>
