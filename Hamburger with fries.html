<h1>The Tasty Recipe</h1>
<h2>How Do You Make A Hamburger With Fries?</h2>
<p>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</p>

<p>Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the mixture is very smooth.</p>

<p>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:</p>

<p>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink a bit in the cooking process.</p>

<p>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press a dent in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking.</p>


<p>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: Homemade cooked hamburger patties will keep well tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, or in an airtight container, in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

<p>Stack the hot patties on hamburger buns, and dress up with your favorite hamburger toppings and condiments and you're done!</p>

<p>To make Fries, 1. Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.), 2. Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries), 3. Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry., 4. Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel., 5. Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes., 6. Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</p>
