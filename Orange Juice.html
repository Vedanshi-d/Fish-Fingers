<h1>The Tasty Recipe</h1>
<h2>How Do You Make Orange Juice?</h2>
<p>Peel the oranges and, optionally, remove and discard the seeds (if you’re going to strain the juice then this isn’t necessary).</p>

<p>Add the orange segments to a blender. You can add a little water to help them blend if needed (1/4 cup should be more than enough not to water it down too much).</p>

<p>Blend into a juicy, pulpy consistency. Then sieve the resulting pulpy juice through a sieve or nut milk bag or alternatively if you like orange juice with pulp (for more nutrients too) then leave it as is.</p>

<p>Fresh squeezed orange juice is best consumed immediately for the maximum amount of nutrients. However, any leftovers can be stored in an airtight glass container in the fridge for up to 3 days.</p>

<p>Orange pulp can also be frozen into an ice-cube tray for later usage – within smoothies, broths, or baked goods. Alternatively, the pulp can be composted.</p>


<p>You can zest some of the skin to add to dishes or to flavor teas, lemonades, or even sugar. Alternatively, make some candied orange peel or, if the halves are in good condition, use them to make orange candles.</p>

<p>In a common (navel) orange, one orange will yield around 1/4-1/3 cup juice. Though, this can vary and will vary a lot between different types of orange.</p>

<p>For ‘instant’ chilled juice, leave the orange in the fridge overnight before juicing (or for 30 minutes in the freezer before juicing). You could also add ice though this will quickly water down the juice.</p>
